# Describe Cloud Concepts

## Introduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services support everything from simple to complex. Azure has simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud. Azure also supports running fully virtualized computers and managing your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) focused services.

In this series, you’ll cover cloud computing basics, be introduced to some of the core services provided by Microsoft Azure, and will learn more about the governance and compliance services that you can use.

## What is Azure Fundamentals?
Azure Fundamentals is a series of three learning paths that familiarize you with Azure and its many services and features.

Whether you're interested in computing, networking, or storage services; learning about cloud security best practices; or exploring governance and management options, think of Azure Fundamentals as your curated guide to Azure.

Azure Fundamentals includes interactive exercises that give you hands-on experience with Azure. Many exercises provide a temporary Azure portal environment called the sandbox, which allows you to practice creating cloud resources for free at your own pace.

Technical IT experience isn't required; however, having general IT knowledge will help you get the most from your learning experience.

## Why should I take Azure Fundamentals?
Whether you're just beginning to work with the cloud or you already have cloud experience, Azure Fundamentals provides everything you need to get started.

No matter your goals, Azure Fundamentals has something for you. You should take this course if you:

- Have a general interest in Azure or cloud computing
- Want to earn official certification from Microsoft (AZ-900)
The Azure Fundamentals learning path series can help you prepare for Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. This exam includes three knowledge domain areas:


Each domain area maps to a learning path in Azure Fundamentals. The percentages shown indicate the relative weight of each area on the exam. The higher the percentage, the more questions that part of the exam will contain. Be sure to read the exam page for specifics about what skills are covered in each area.

This training helps you develop a broad understanding of Azure.

# Introduction to cloud computing

In this module, you’ll be introduced to general cloud concepts. You’ll start with an introduction to the cloud in general. Then you'll dive into concepts like shared responsibility, different cloud models, and explore the unique pricing method for the cloud.

If you’re already familiar with cloud computing, this module may be largely review for you.

## Learning objectives
After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Define cloud computing.
- Describe the shared responsibility model.
- Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
- Describe the consumption-based model.
- Compare cloud pricing models.

**Consumption-Based Model**
==========================

### Key Characteristics

* **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: Customers only pay for the resources used, without any upfront costs or fixed monthly
fees.
* **Metered usage**: Resources are measured and billed based on actual usage, such as number of users,
transactions, or data transferred.
* **Variable pricing**: Pricing is adjusted based on demand, usage patterns, or other factors to ensure fair and
competitive rates.

### Benefits

* **Reduced costs**: Customers only pay for what they use, reducing waste and minimizing unnecessary expenses.
* **Increased flexibility**: Consumption-based models offer greater flexibility, as customers can scale up or down
to match changing needs.
* **Improved forecasting**: With clear visibility into usage patterns, organizations can better forecast their
costs and make more informed decisions.

### Example Pricing Structure

| Service | Unit of Measurement | Price per Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | GB/month | $0.02/GB |
| Compute | vCore/hour | $0.10/vCore/hour |
| Network | Mbps/month | $0.05/Mbps |

In this example, the pricing structure is based on metered usage of storage, compute resources, and network
bandwidth.

### Consumption-Based Model Types

* **Per-GB pricing**: Charges customers for each GB of storage used.
* **Per-vCore pricing**: Charges customers for each virtual core (vCore) used.
* **Per-Mbps pricing**: Charges customers for each megabit per second (Mbps) of network bandwidth used.


# IAAS, PAAS, SAAS
**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

* Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
* Customers have full control over infrastructure and can provision, configure, and manage their own resources
* Examples:
 + Virtual machines (VMs)
 + Storage services
 + Networking services
* Benefits:
 + Flexibility and scalability
 + Cost-effective for small to medium-sized applications
 + Can be used as a foundation for PaaS or SaaS deployments

**PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

* Provides a complete platform for developing, running, and managing applications
* Customers don't have to manage infrastructure or underlying systems
* Examples:
 + Web application hosting platforms (e.g., Azure App Service)
 + Database services
 + Development environments
* Benefits:
 + Reduced administrative burden on developers
 + Faster time-to-market for applications
 + Cost-effective for small to medium-sized applications

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**

* Provides software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance
* Customers use the application without having control over infrastructure or underlying systems
* Examples:
 + Microsoft Office 365
 + Salesforce.com
 + Google Workspace
* Benefits:
 + Reduced capital expenditure on software licenses
 + Improved accessibility and collaboration features
 + Scalability and reliability built into the service

In summary, IaaS provides a foundation for infrastructure, PaaS provides a platform for application development and deployment, while SaaS offers pre-built
applications that can be accessed over the internet.
